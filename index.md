-----------------

Well well. Welcome.

I am a Machine Learning/Deep Learning researcher, software/data engineer, and academically trained computational physicist with a PhD. I have developed an expertise in, with great independence, building world-leading **Deep Learning models**, massively **parallel compute systems** and **neural search engines**. I have delivered crucial and challenging projects that others hesitate to take on. In 2021 I created a facial recognition [algorithm](https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reportcards/11/clearviewai_000.html) ranked **US #1** and **World #2** among top companies and research institutions. In 2022 I drove the research and implementation into a **deca-billion-scale** face search engine that was **500+** times the throughput of state of the art, leading to true scalability and future cost savings on the level of ten million dollars. My push towards technological advances has enabled business directions otherwise not viable. As a result my work has gotten some [media coverage](#media-highlights).

During my academic years I published [14](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AT89GwYAAAAJ&hl=en) peer-reviewed papers in high-quality scientific journals, presented in international conferences and mentored junior researchers. Currently I work in the industry and have several patents [granted](https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/applications/17676914) or in the pipeline. They represent the cutting edge of the **computer vision biometrics** & **neural search domain**. See more at [Research](/research).

In addition, I have led teams and pushed them to excellence with fairness and empathy. I love being a team player and seek to understand established working patterns before instituting change. I make it a point to communicate and share knowledge that enriches and empowers my peers. I enjoy new challenges and seek to align my skills where they matter the most.

I maintain a [Blog](/blog) and write occasionally.

## <u>EXPERIENCE</u>

### Clearview AI, Inc

_Vice President, Research, 2021 - Present_

I had previously worked on facial recognition back in 2017, and really wanted to solve the two biggest problems in the industry - the accuracy of the algorithm, and the accuracy & scalability of the face search engine at increasingly large sizes (deca-billion scale and more). Clearview was the perfect opportunity for me. I ended up solving them in each of the two years when I was there.

During this time I got to be the sole person pushing through from data collection, pipelining, cleaning, preprocessing, training & experimentation, model productionization, all the way to indexing for search at a very large scale. These tasks encompass almost the entirety of the industrial ML/DL specializations. The hands-on technical experience and intuition I gained from them were priceless.

I also carried various projects from research & prototyping to production in accelerated time frames, and obtained very concrete rules to determine progress in a sea of complexity. I defined the Technology Process: problem definition & claim, strategizing & planning, solving & characterization, and production implementation stages. I made sure to communicate the expectations and stop gaps at each stage. With a few projects completed, I demonstrated that technology leadership could be driven out of a persistent vision.

Since the algorithm's debut success, I became the trusted expert on the core tech in the leadership team and took on the scientific authority in product marketing and policy & legal messaging. I built the Research/ML division, laid out the technological foundation and assembled a team. I was very keen on nurturing the team, sharing knowledge, and recording sessions for broader access & history keeping, a practice I picked up during the pandemic remote working environment. Recently I came across a book [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-staff-engineers-path) (highly recommend!) and found a lot of common themes.

I encountered a vast lineup of technologies along the way, and became a proficient user in order to get the most out of them. They ranged from general SWE products like **protobuf & gRPC**, **RocksDB**, **Redis Stream**, **Datadog**, to Deep Learning specific ones like **MXNet**, **PyTorch**, **OpenCV**, **OpenVINO**, **ONNX Runtime**, **ncnn**, **CuPy**, **TensorRT**, GPU batching utility **service streamer**, **K-nearest neighbors** algorithms. I had to take face detectors and embedders apart in pieces and put them back together with different acceleration framework backends to understand how to create the best interfaces. I fusioned three tough C++ libraries (and more utility ones) together to arrive at what I needed for things to scale. They were incredibly challenging and equally fun.

* Created a facial recognition [algorithm](https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/reportcards/11/clearviewai_000.html) ranked **US #1** and **World #2**.
* Research & implemented a **deca-billion-scale** face search engine that was **500+** times the throughput of SOTA, leading to true scalability and future cost savings on the level of ten million dollars.
* Designed massive data pipelines with dense compute saturating hardware resource constraints. Perfected efficient parallelized model training using tens of nodes and GPUs.
* Pushed models to be more lightweight and efficient with distillation training, quantization, pruning & trimming and hardware acceleration. Streamlined deployment with model encryption and serving engines.
* Laid out the company ML/Research foundation and built a team.
* Worked to get the right science and messaging in marketing campaigns with public letters and engagement to policy officials.

### Bloomberg, LP

_Senior Software Engineer, 2017 - 2021_

I moved into the industry and realized I really liked to work with computers in a more general capacity. In order to take things to the next level, I needed more rigorous training in Software Engineering. At Bloomberg I became serious with **C++** (it's a C++ shop after all!), **Operating Systems**, **System Design**, **DevOps & Platform Engineering**, **Docker**, **Cloud**, etc. I took special interest in scalable data pipeline and database components, like **Apache Kafka**, **Redis** (still have a T-shirt from Redis Day in NYC!), **MongoDB**, etc. Meanwhile I kept learning about ML/AI on the side.

* Maintained the widely-used Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) infrastructure.
* Developed the next-generation SFTP backed by Bloomberg Cloud Computing and Storage with file system emulation. Designed & implemented reliable account & routing management and robust messaging control. Wrote OS-level modules and plugins for **OpenSSH**.
* Safeguarded successful year-long high-stake account migration as technical lead.

### University of Toledo

_Ph.D., Physics, 2012 – 2017_

I spent 4 years as a funded researcher working on crystalline materials simulation with Density-Functional Theory on supercomputing clusters. I became proficient with **Linux** and **Python** and their **scientific computing** eco-systems, e.g. **NumPy**, **SciPy**, **matplotlib**, **pandas**, etc. It naturally paved my way to the growing Data Science and Machine Learning fields, and as soon as GPUs became more available, Deep Learning. I took a lot of additional courses to be fully equipped in these domains before dissertation defense.

During this time I published [14](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AT89GwYAAAAJ&hl=en) peer-reviewed papers with ~600 citations. I got the opportunities to present in numerous international conferences, and mentored three undergraduate and two graduate students.

Additional courses:

* Statistical Inference (MATH 8650)
* Categorical Data Analysis (MATH 8620)
* Topics In Statistics (MATH 8640)
* Statistical Consulting (MATH 8600)

Online courses:

* Introduction to Databases (Stanford) - with Distinction
* Algorithms, Part I (Princeton)
* Introduction to Probability and Data (Duke)
* Inferential Statistics (Duke)

### Nanjing University

_Bachelor of Science, Materials Science & Engineering, 2008 – 2012_

This major was interdisciplinary in nature. As a result I studied a broad range of subjects: materials science & engineering, physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, computer science, math, statistics, etc. I also prepared and participated in a mathematical modeling contest with a team that focused on operations research using MATLAB and Mathematica.
