<p>Well well. Welcome.</p>

<p>I'm a data scientist turned from a computational physicist. I do research,
model building, workflow programming, data analysis & visualization and
website design.</p>

<p>I’ve done a few projects, including a camera feed facial recognition application, a
state-of-the-art Web application to search ten million celebrity faces, an
assignment of political contribution identity verification with extensive
webpage scraping and database lookups, cleaning and extraction, a Kaggle
competition on rental listing interest level prediction, a feature-rich database
on ceramic materials, a homework collector that accepts Web and email submission
and verification, reports using predictive modeling, feature engineering,
natural language processing for regression and classification and some Python
packages to provide convenience and simplicity in modeling job routines. I’ve
published 10 peer-reviewed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">papers</a> in
high-quality scientific journals with 130+ citations and presented in numerous
international conferences.</p>

<h3>Offline Video Facial Recognition/Object Detection</h3>
<blockquote>
    Comapared with its camera feed application counterpart, this application opens doors to more intensive offline parallel processing with supercomputing clusters, leveraging heavier neural networks, and ensures precise frame-by-frame operations. Tens of objects can be detected for each frame so that search can be exhaustive.

<h3>Camera Feed Facial Recognition/Object Detection</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Built an application to display camera feed and perform facial recognition and object detection **in real time** (24+ fps on a Mac) in Python with core C++ function calls (dlib and TensorFlow). Extensive effort was put to multithreading/processing and load balancing so that program can run fast even on a Raspberry Pi. User can toggle different states, e.g. display, training, recognizing. Can record logged-in user list and do all sorts of things. This is a project that blends AI (image/face transformation) and machine learning models (for identity classification) with good engineering and programming and can unleash a great deal of potential.</p>

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/facesearch">Ten Million Celebrity Faces Search</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Built a state-of-the-art Web application with MongoDB and Flask to detect, transform and index features of ten million faces and allow very fast searches with user uploaded photos. The application leverages the latest computer vision neural networks (dlib), nearest neighbors and clustering algorithms (Faiss), and can be used to further derive otherwise hard-to-get information.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml">Political Contribution Identity Verification</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Performed extensive automated webpage scraping. Queried a 20-million-entry PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy and pandas. Wrote complex regular-expression-based fuzzy lookups, cleaning and extraction on name, employer and occupation information of contributors. Used machine learning models to evaluate positive identification based on distance between zip code and a list of possible zip codes.</p>
