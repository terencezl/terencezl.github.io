<p>Well well. Welcome.</p>

<p>I'm a data scientist turned from a computational physicist. I do research, model building, workflow programming,
    data analysis & visualization and website design.
</p>

<p>I’ve done a few projects, including an ongoing Kaggle competition on rental listing interest level prediction, a
    feature-rich database on ceramic materials, reports using predictive modeling, feature engineering, natural language
    processing for regression and classification and some Python packages to provide convenience and simplicity in modeling job
    routines. I’ve published 10 peer-reviewed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">papers</a> in high-quality
    scientific journals with 100+ citations and presented in numerous international conferences.</p>
