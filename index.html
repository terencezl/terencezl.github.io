<hr>

<p>Well well. Welcome.</p>

<p>I'm a data scientist turned from a computational physicist. I do research,
model building, workflow programming, data analysis & visualization and
website design.</p>

<p>I’ve done a few projects, including a camera feed facial recognition app, a
state-of-the-art Web application to search ten million celebrity faces, an
assignment of political contribution identity verification with extensive
webpage scraping and database lookups, cleaning and extraction, a Kaggle
competition on rental listing interest level prediction, a feature-rich database
on ceramic materials, a homework collector that accepts Web and email submission
and verification, reports using predictive modeling, feature engineering,
natural language processing for regression and classification and some Python
packages to provide convenience and simplicity in modeling job routines. I’ve
published 10 peer-reviewed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">papers</a> in
high-quality scientific journals with 120+ citations and presented in numerous
international conferences.</p>

<h3>Camera Feed Facial Recognition</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Built a Python application to display camera feed and perform facial recognition **in real time**. Extensive effort was put to multiprocessing and load balancing so that program can run fast even on a Raspberry Pi. User can toggle different states, e.g. display, training, recognizing. Can record logged-in user list and do all sorts of things. This is a project that blends machine learning models (for identity classification), AI (image/face transformation) with good engineering and programming and can unleash a great deal of potential.</p>

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/facesearch">Ten Million Celebrity Faces Search</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Built a state-of-the-art Web application with MongoDB and Flask to detect, transform and index features of ten million faces and allow very fast searches with user uploaded photos. The application leverages the latest computer vision neural networks (dlib), nearest neighbors and clustering algorithms (Faiss), and can be used to further derive otherwise hard-to-get information.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.fec.gov/finance/disclosure/ftpdet.shtml">Political Contribution Identity Verification</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Performed extensive automated webpage scraping. Queried a 20-million-entry PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy and pandas. Wrote complex regular-expression-based fuzzy lookups, cleaning and extraction on name, employer and occupation information of contributors. Used machine learning models to evaluate positive identification based on distance between zip code and a list of possible zip codes.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/terencezl/kaggle-rental-listing-inquiries">Kaggle Competition: Rental Listing
    Inquiries</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Built machine learning classification models (SVMs, random forests, boosted trees) with scikit-learn to predict viewer interest levels of 80k rental listings. Performed text feature engineering and model comparison.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://astro1.panet.utoledo.edu/ceramicsdb">Ceramics Database</a></h3>
<blockquote>
    <p>Lead a two-person team. The database is built with Django and MySQL, equipped with modern mobile Web technologies. Customized tabulation/graphing, user registration and contribution are supported. Project helped get $100,000 research grant.</p>
