<hr>

<p>Well well. Welcome.</p>

<p>I'm a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Toledo. I specialize in computational materials modeling. This means working with supercomputers and transforming theories into implementations with the understanding of fundamental physical principles. See my <a href="/research">research</a> interests and a list of publications.</p>

<p>I'm also a programmer, engaged in data-related <a href="/projects">projects</a> with languages such as SQL and Python. In 2014 I created a fully functional database-driven <a href="http://astro1.panet.utoledo.edu/ceramicsdb/">website</a> on ceramic materials.</p>

<p>I intend to become a data scientist, and am in the active process of make the transition.</p>
