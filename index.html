<p>Well well. Welcome.</p>

<p>I'm a computational materials physicist turned data scientist. I do research, model building, workflow programming, data analysis &
    visualization and website design.</p>

<p>I’ve done a few <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects">projects</a>, including a database on calculated properties of ceramic materials,
    some Python packages to provide convenience and simplicity in modeling job routines and people are happy to use
    them. I’ve published 10 peer-reviewed <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">papers</a> in high-quality scientific journals.</p>
