I write about systems - technical systems, organizational systems, and the space where the two intersect. Earlier posts focus heavily on performance, infrastructure, and low-level implementation details, because you can't reason clearly about tradeoffs without understanding the mechanics. However, most system failures aren't caused by insufficient optimization - they're caused by misaligned decisions.

So in addition to the low-level details, this blog also explores:

- When performance work is worth doing (and when it isn't)
- Why "technically correct" solutions often fail in practice
- How infrastructure choices shape team velocity
- How to evaluate new technologies under uncertainty
