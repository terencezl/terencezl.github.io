title: "What Makes a Good Technical Leader?"
---

Jotting down the notes.

* Technical leadership - databases, distributed systems, compute fundamentals, Cloud security, scaling and tradeoffs, build vs buy, etc.
* Product sense & strategy - how to derive intuition from market research, and how to validate ideas before committing the team
* Leadership style - org design, leveling, talent strategy, how to drive the team, how to evaluate them and apply productive pressure, how to hire
* Technical communication - simplification of systems, and use of analogies
* Living the values & principles to build rapport and trust with their [first team](https://www.michaelvizdos.com/resources/first-team) - increasingly more important as the business grows bigger
