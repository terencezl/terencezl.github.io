title: "People are Computers"
---

There are a lot of analogies between people in a team setting, and computers. Calling out some of these analogies helps tremendously when it come to scaling a team.

* raw intelligence <> chip processor clock frequency (and turbo when drinking coffee)
* learning-based skill-up <> advanced instruction set / specialization
* unblocking each other <> embarrassingly parallel patterns / minimizing work in the critical region / indirection / atomicity
* work prioritization <> priority queue / nice values
* work validation and feedback loops <> compile-time type checking / schema validation / fail-fast design
* work planning around existing interfaces/checkpoints & migration <> compiler optimization upholding invariants / pipeline parallelism
