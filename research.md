`11`. [Transparency enhancement for SrVO\\(\_3\\) by SrTiO\\(\_3\\) mixing: A first-principles study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092702561730705X)

**Z. T. Y. Liu**, N. J. Podraza, S. V. Khare, P. Sarin, *Comput. Mater. Sci.* **144**, 139-146 (2018)

> We have studied the mixing of SrVO\\(\_3\\) and SrTiO\\(\_3\\) with ab initio based simulation methods. We confirmed feasibility of obtaining full-composition-range solid solutions SrTi\\(\_{1-x}\\)V\\(\_x\\)O\\(\_3\\). Substitution of V with Ti reduces electrical conductivity to negligible level at x = 0.67. Such substitution suppresses the optical absorption beyond 3.25 eV. Doping/vacancy creation could enhance conductivity while allowing for optical tuning.

Our ab initio density functional theory studies successfully reproduced the observed crystalline-to-crystalline structural transitions.

Y. Wang, **Z. T. Y. Liu**, S. V. Khare, S. A. Collins, J. Zhang, L. Wang and Y. Zhao, *Appl. Phys. Lett.* **108**, 061906 (2016)

> A large volume press coupled with *in-situ* energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray was used to probe the change of silicon carbide (SiC) under high pressure and temperature (*P-T*) up to 8.1 GPa and 1100 K. The obtained pressure–volume–temperature data were fitted to a modified high-*T* Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, yielding values of a series of thermo-elastic parameters. In addition, the elastic properties of SiC were determined by density functional theory through the calculation of Helmholtz free energy.

`5`. [Pressure-induced transition in the multiferroic CoCr\\(_2\\)O\\(_4\\) spinel](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.92.064108)

> We have explored the high-pressure structural, vibrational, electronic, and magnetic behavior of the multiferroic CoCr\\(_2\\)O\\(_4\\) spinel up to 30 GPa by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. Our investigations revealed a reversible tetragonal distortion of the starting cubic structure above 16 GPa. We suggest that the structural modification is mainly driven by magnetic effects induced under pressure.
