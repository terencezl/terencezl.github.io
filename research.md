`7`. [Structural transition in the magnetoelectric ZnCr\\(_2\\)Se\\(_4\\) spinel under pressure](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.93.174103) 

I. Efthimiopoulos, **Z. T. Y. Liu**, S. V. Khare, P. Sarin, V. Tsurkan, A. Loidl, D. Popov and Y. Wang, *Phys. Rev. B* **93**, 174103 (2016)

> Τhe magnetoelectric ZnCr\\(_2\\)Se\\(_4\\) spinel, with space group Fd-3m, undergoes a reversible first-order structural transition initiating at 17 GPa, as revealed by our high-pressure X-ray diffraction studies at room temperature. Our density functional theory calculations successfully reproduce the structural transition.

`6`. [Thermal Equation of State of Silicon Carbide](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl/108/6/10.1063/1.4941797)

Y. Wang, **Z. T. Y. Liu**, S. V. Khare, S. A. Collins, J. Zhang, L. Wang and Y. Zhao, *Appl. Phys. Lett.* **108**, 061906 (2016)

> A large volume press coupled with *in-situ* energy-dispersive synchrotron X-ray was used to probe the change of silicon carbide (SiC) under high pressure and temperature (*P-T*) up to 8.1 GPa and 1100 K. The obtained pressure–volume–temperature data were fitted to a modified high-*T* Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, yielding values of a series of thermo-elastic parameters. In addition, the elastic properties of SiC were determined by density functional theory through the calculation of Helmholtz free energy.

`5`. [Pressure-induced transition in the multiferroic CoCr\\(_2\\)O\\(_4\\) spinel](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.92.064108)

I. Efthimiopoulos, **Z. T. Y. Liu**, S. V. Khare, P. Sarin, T. Lochbiler, V. Tsurkan, A. Loidl, D. Popov, and Y. Wang, *Physical Rreview B*, **92**, 064108 (2015)

> We have explored the high-pressure structural, vibrational, electronic, and magnetic behavior of the multiferroic CoCr\\(_2\\)O\\(_4\\) spinel up to 30 GPa by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations. Our investigations revealed a reversible tetragonal distortion of the starting cubic structure above 16 GPa. We suggest that the structural modification is mainly driven by magnetic effects induced under pressure.

`4`. [Electronic and bonding analysis of hardness in pyrite-type transition-metal pernitrides](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.90.134102)

**Z. T. Y. Liu**, D. Gall and S. V. Khare, *Physical Review B* **90**, 134102 (2014)

> We answer the question of the exceptional mechanical properties of pyrite-type PtN\\(_2\\) by a systematic computational analysis of it and other pyrite-type transition-metal pernitrides *M*N\\(_2\\) with density functional theory.

J. L. Roehl, **Z. T. Y. Liu** and S. V. Khare, *Materials Research Express* **1**, 025904 (2014)

> We present an *ab initio* study of the diffusion profiles in CdS of native, Cd and S vacancies, and interstitial adatoms Cd, S, Te, Cu, and Cl.

**Z. T. Y. Liu**, X. Zhou, S. V. Khare and D. Gall, *Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter* **26**, 025404 (2014)

> We report systematic results from *ab initio* calculations with density functional theory on three cubic structures, zincblende (zb), rocksalt (rs) and cesium chloride (cc), of the ten 3d transition metal nitrides. We computed lattice constants, elastic constants, their derived mechanical moduli, ratios and Vickers hardness.

**Z. T. Y. Liu**, X. Zhou, D. Gall and S. V. Khare, *Computational Materials Science* **84**, 365 (2014)

> We have performed *ab initio* calculations on 29 nitride phases of transition metals from the 3d, 4d and 5d rows, in NbO structure. We calculated cohesive energy, lattice constant and elastic constants \\(C\_{11}\\), \\(C\_{12}\\) and \\(C\_{44}\\), and derived mechanical moduli, related ratios and Vickers hardness.
